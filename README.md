# BostonTravel

## About 

The Poblem: Walking tours are a great way to learn about an area. Unfortunately, guided tours are often expensive and require that you stick with the group and your guide, with little to no time to do your own exploring. 

Solution: Boston Tours brings interactive maps of 3 hisotrical tours in Boston: Freedom trail, Harbour walk and Harvard yard walk for free. Each  historical landmarks on the map comes with audio content and GPS location pitpoint. 

## To do:
-Display historic photos of your current location. When you hold your phone up, you can overlay a historic picture over your current view and slowly toggle between the two.
